### 📺 Interfaces
We are developing virtual and digital interfaces for music making. 

#### `wind-field`
The first such interface is based on the [Teenage Engineering OP-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_Engineering_OP-1) and [OP–1 field](https://teenage.engineering/products/op-1). For fun, we consider what the OP–1 would look and play like if it were optimized for a flutist or any wind instrumentalist. We imagine this emulation of the OP–1 as a partner in both musical composition and improvisation for our wind-bending friends and affectionately call this interface _wind-field_.

### ✨ Visualizations
We are developing design and visualization algorithms for affect (i.e., biometric and physiological data), audio, and environment.
